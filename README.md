# My Math Python Package
## Sample Tutorial Package
My Math is a sample package created by while taking the **IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate** course on [Coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/).
The package has three libraries: `Basic`, `Stats`, and `Geometry`

### Basic
The Basic library hold these functions:
* **Square** Usage: `mymath.basic.square(number)`
  *For returning the square of a number.*
* **Double** Usage: `mymath.basic.double(input)`
  *For returning double the value of the number entered. (Or returning a doubled string*
* **Add** Usage: `mymath.basic.add(input1, input2)`
  *For returning the sum of two numbers. (Or returning the concatenated result of two string inputs*

### Stats
The Stats library holds these functions:
* **Mean** Usage: `mymath.stats.mean([numbers])`
  *Returns the mean of the given list of numbers*
*  **Median** Usage: `mymath.stats.median([numbers])`
  *Returns the median of a given list of numbers*

### Geometry
The Geometry library holds these functions:
* **Area_of_rectangle** Usage: `mymath.geometry.area_of_rectangle(width, height)`
  *Returns the area of a rectangle given its width and height. No inputs returns area of 1.*
* **Area_of_circle** Usage: `mymath.geometry.area_of_circle(radius)`
  *Returns the area of a circle given its radius. No input returns  and area of π1² (or just "π").*
